# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The BayOrder team and community take security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities using public GitHub issues.**

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please send an email to us at:

**[YOUR_SECURITY_EMAIL@example.com]**

Please include the following details in your report:

* A descriptive title.
* A detailed description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
* Which application (`customer` or `owner`) is affected.
* Your name and a link to your website or profile (if you wish to be credited).

We will do our best to respond to your report within 48 hours and will keep you updated on the progress of any fixes. We ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.
